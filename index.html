                            <div class="text_intro"> <p>Before I start a story about my long-long way on the IT, I want to note that I really 
                                enjoy studying! How said Howard Wolowitz: “Smart Is The New Sexy”. When I
                                entered BSU, the subjects that caused the fear were mathematics and 
                                programming. (Especially mathematics, because there were two!)<br><br>
                                
                                Why programming? I don’t remember maybe because then I only knew PascalABC
                                and didn’t understand OOP principles and how I can apply them. But it was time
                                for exams, I read a huge amount of literature like Object-Oriented Programming in
                                C++ by Lafore and I started to get it. (By the way, my teacher gave me eight 
                                because <br> she believed that girls can’t programming or maybe she just didn’t like me).<br><br>
                                
                                In classroom we created desktop applications like calculator or text editor, but in
                                this process is more liked to think over frontend part. Then summer came and I
                                went to Java courses. I’m inclined to believe that choose Java because it was 
                                intuitive to me. I felt out of place when I was going there. Now I can’t say that it 
                                was wasted because I got to know teamwork and a community of amazing
                                people. Then I decided to try something new that didn’t feel like Java or C++, in 
                                winter I took online-courses of programming in HTML and CSS. And now I’m here 
                                to learn new things and develop!</p>
