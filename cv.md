**I will be glad to receive any information and announcements!**

Before I start a story about my long-long way on the IT, I want to note that I really enjoy studying! How said **Howard Wolowitz**: "*Smart Is The New Sexy*". When I entered BSU, the subjects that caused the fear were mathematics and programming. (Especially mathematics, because there were two!)

Why programming? I don't remember maybe because then I only knew PascalABC and didn't understand OOP principles and how I can apply them. But it was time for exams, I read a huge amount of literature like Object-Oriented Programming in C++ by Lafore and I started to get it. (By the way, my teacher gave me eight because she believed that girls can't programming or maybe she just didn't like me).

In classroom we created desktop applications like calculator or text editor, but in this process is more liked to think over frontend part. Then summer came and I went to Java courses. I'm inclined to believe that choose Java because it was intuitive to me. I felt out of place when I was going there. Now I can't say that it was wasted because I got to know teamwork and a community of amazing people. Then I decided to try something new that didn't feel like Java or C++, in winter I took online-courses of programming in HTML and CSS. And now I'm here to learn new things and develop!
